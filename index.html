<H3>What is MicroService:</H3> 
The basic concept of a microservice is simple: it’s a small application that does one thing only, and does that one thing well. A microservice is a small component that is easily replaceable, independently developed, and independently deployable. A microservice cannot live alone, however — no microservice is an island — and it is part of a larger system, running and working alongside other microservices to accomplish what would normally be handled by one large standalone application.

The goal of microservice architecture is to build a set of small applications that are each responsible for performing one function (as opposed to the traditional way of building one application that does everything), and to let each microservice be autonomous, independent, and self-contained. The core difference between a monolithic application and microservices is this: a monolithic application (Figure 1) will contain all features and functions within one application and one codebase, all deployed at the same time, with each server hosting a complete copy of the entire application, while a microservice (Figure 2) contains only one function or feature and lives in a microservice ecosystem along with other microservices that each perform one function or feature.

There are numerous benefits to adopting microservice architecture — including (but not limited to) reduced technical debt, improved developer productivity and velocity, better testing efficiency, increased scalability, and ease of deployment.
